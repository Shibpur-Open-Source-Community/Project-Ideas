## Rubik's Cube Solver

Imagine you didnt have to solve a gruesome rubik's cube anymore, instead ask a computer to do it for you.

**It took Ernő Rubik one whole month to learn how to solve his first Rubik’s cube.**

### The Project Idea

Each Rubik's cube unsolved state can be thought of as a node in a graph.
Solving from one state to another we go from one node to another until we get the desired solved state(node).


So some unsolved states to start with, leading to more such states and more creating an exponential heap and ulitmately converging down to a solved state.

A simple Breadth First Algorithm would work its way.


There can be 3 possible stages

* Encoding each rubiks cube state
* Algorithm
* Gui
