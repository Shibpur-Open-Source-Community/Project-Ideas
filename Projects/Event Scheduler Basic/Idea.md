## Event scheduling

This project will be based on a facebook style basic event scheduler, where any registered user can create an event. The event can be sent to different emails. Each email will have 3 choices. Going, Interested and Maybe. 

If the user selects Going/Interested, the user will receive notifications preferably a day before reminding him/her of the event.


* Lets start with simple

* Create a website where user can login and register. More discussion needed on how to host this website.

* After login, create event.

* Invite members by email. Members can be both registered and unregistered users.

* Each email will have three options. Going, Interested, Maybe

* If someone chooses Going/Interested, he/she will receive a timely reminder about the event.
