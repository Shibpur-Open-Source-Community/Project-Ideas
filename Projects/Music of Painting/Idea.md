## Converting a painting to music

This project will aim to solve problems for monochromasia persons
Those who cant identify colors in the everyday world, literally color blind , for them this will take art to something great for them.


* Lets start with simple

* First we create a simple website where we can upload some pics, paintings

* We analyse the RGB values from the picture

* Each such RGB value can be related to a sound frequency.

* Thereby, from a whole picture we get an array of RGB values which can be converted to a frequency (buzzer) value

* That's how the pic gets converted to sound. And if its a great pic, with a continuity in the RGB values throughout a level, we can ensure a great tune


## Final Goal

To build an extension which we can add to chrome web store, so that it can be used by millions


There is a lot to be explored here and there's all the fun.
