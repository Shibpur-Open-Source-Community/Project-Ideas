## Face matching

Face matching app/website using a simple k-nearest-neighbours algorithm. 


* We upload our DP.

* Once, we have sufficient images in our database (around 30), we can find a face that matches the most with my face.

* We display both the faces and mention the confidence with which those faces may be same. Duplicate images will not be queried.

* More functionality may be added later or this project may be changed to serve a more diverse purpose.


## Final Goal

To build, implement and deploy the a project from start to finish.

ML experience is not needed. Just go through the k-nearest-neighbour algorithm.
